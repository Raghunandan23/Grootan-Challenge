# Grootan-Challenge

## Process Explaination

* Create a Mock API using Beeceptor.com to fetch the list of users.
* Add up the Dummy Sign In and Sign Up page.
* After Sign In, redirect the page to the List of users displayed.
* In that page we can view the list of users.
* There on clicking View Details, we can view the Details about the users.
* I have made the website responsive and user-friendly.

### Important Note

### I have deployed the porject on Heroku Website Hosting Platform, due to the 50 limt requests on Beeceptor APT it will not display the list of users. So, I have included the implentation screenshot which will be helpful.
